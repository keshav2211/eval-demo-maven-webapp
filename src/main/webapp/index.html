The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects-devices, vehicles, buildings and other items which are embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and exchange data.

        <td>
          As of 2013, the vision of the Internet of Things has evolved due to a convergence of multiple technologies, ranging from wireless communication to the Internet and from embedded systems to micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS).
        </td>

	<td>
          ABI Research estimates that more than 30 billion devices will be wirelessly connected to the Internet of Things by 2020.
	</td>

         <td>
          A large majority of the technology experts and engaged Internet users agreed with the notion that the Internet/Cloud of Things, embedded and wearable computing will have widespread and beneficial effects by 2025.
        </td>

	<td>
	In an active move to accommodate new and emerging technological innovation, the UK Government, in their 2015 budget, allocated 40 million pounds towards research into the Internet of Things.
	</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          Integration with the Internet implies that devices will use an IP address as a unique identifier. However, due to the limited address space of IPv4, objects in the IoT will have to use IPv6.
        </td>

	<td>
   	 Objects in the IoT will not only be devices with sensory capabilities, but also provide actuation capabilities (e.g., bulbs or locks controlled over the Internet).
	</td>

         <td>
          The ability to network embedded devices with limited CPU, memory and power resources means that IoT finds applications in nearly every field.
        </td>

	<td>
	 The concept of an "internet of living things" has been proposed to describe networks of biological sensors that could use cloud-based analyses to allow users to study DNA or other molecules.
